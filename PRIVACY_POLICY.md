## Trackday Excuses: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Trackday Excuses app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Philip Callender. The source code is available on GitHub under the GNU AGPL license (3.0 or later).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

This application is just a fun spinning wheel, randomly displaying strings from an array. It does not record or save anything, or communicate with any other software or system,
and it's only input is the button to start the wheel spinning.

Feel free to inspect the source code.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Philip Callender.
